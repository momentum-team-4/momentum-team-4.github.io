Hey everyone, hope you're having a good weekend. Here's some links to go with the assignment you're working on this weekend, including slides and another example to look at. I've also included previews of the games you'll be choosing from for your final projects. The next week will be tough, but we're going to come out of it better coders (and/or teachers)!
