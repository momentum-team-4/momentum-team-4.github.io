### Assignment
The link below is to a near-copy of the assignment you've been working on, but with some instructions for adding objects. It's not really a "new" assignment, but crteating a new assignment seemed like a convenient way to provide the instructions (and a convenient way to provide you with a new working directory if you want to try a different approach).
