This week, we'll be focusing on going further with Django before we dive into REST APIs.

Today, we'll be talking about deploying our Django apps to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Assignments

Your project for the week will be [Question Box](https://classroom.github.com/a/svbpk3MP). Today, you'll start by getting this deployed to Heroku first thing.
