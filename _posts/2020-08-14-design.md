I wanted to leave you all with some design tips and links for your weekend assignment.

First, if you need help picking out colors, check out [coolors](https://coolors.co/). I could spend hours looking at color schemes here.

Next, please read [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://learnui.design/blog/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1.html) by Erik Kennedy. The article's in 2 parts, so please read both. The first rule is odd and mainly only applies to mobile apps, but the next six are very important for the web.
