So far, we've used JavaScript on its own for everything, with only one library, [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). This is called _vanilla JavaScript_.

There are many libraries out there to help us use JavaScript more effectively. We're going to look today at the most commonly used JavaScript library, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

## Project

[Memory Game](https://classroom.github.com/a/_znlMuKo). This is due on Thursday. By this afternoon, have a plan on how to accomplish this; we will discuss those plans in the afternoon session.
