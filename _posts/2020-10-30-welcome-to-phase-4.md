title: Welcome to Phase 4! ðŸŽ‰
tags: phase-4 agile product ideas
---

The past twelve weeks have prepared you to take on the challenge ahead in these next four weeks. Your goal is to design and build a real-world software product, working collaboratively on a small team using agile development practices and all the tools you've learned -- and some you will learn as you go.

At the end of the phase, your team will present your product to an audience of local tech professionals, hiring partners, and your peers.

The experience of working on a team during this phase and the product you build will form the foundation for your job search after graduation.

**You will not begin writing code for your project until Friday of this week.**

## Monday's topics

- Brainstorming product ideas

## Your schedule for this week

We will meet from 1-3 PM Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. We *will not* meet on Tuesday, as it is Election Day and we want to make sure you have time to go vote.

- *Monday*: Brainstorming product ideas and project roles
- *Wednesday*: Refining and documenting your idea
- *Thursday*: Writing user stories and agile development
- *Friday*: Check-in and beginning of coding
