Today, we talked about:

- using viewsets and routers
- token-based authentication
- making custom permission classes

For this weekend, you need to finish up your API for QuestionBox. Specifically,

- all questions and answers can be read via the API
- questions and answers can be created via the API
- proper permissions are on questions and answers
  - questions can be deleted by their author
  - answers can be edited and deleted by their author
  - answers can be marked correct **by the author of their question** (bonus)
