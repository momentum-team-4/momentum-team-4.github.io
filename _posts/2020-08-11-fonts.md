title: Add a font to fix the symbols in your terminal
---

In your terminal, you may have a missing symbol before your branch name, like below:

![](/assets/img/bad-font.png)

If you do, you may want to add a font that contains these symbols. The easiest one to get and install is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). Read the installation instructions on that site to get it installed.

To then change the font you are using in iTerm, go to the preferences and find JetBrains Mono in your profile. Your preferences screen should look like the following:

![](/assets/img/change-font-iterm.png)

And you should be good to go.
