Today, we looked at how to filter data using the query string, make new actions in a ModelViewSet, upload images, and write our first test! (That is a whole lot of stuff.)

Some resources we used:

- [Filtering against query parameters (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#filtering-against-query-parameters)
- [Marking extra actions for routing (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#marking-extra-actions-for-routing)
- [File upload with Django REST Framework](https://www.goodcode.io/articles/django-rest-framework-file-upload/)
- [Serving files uploaded by a user during development](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/static-files/#serving-files-uploaded-by-a-user-during-development)
- [FileUploadParser (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/parsers/#fileuploadparser)
- [Writing and running tests in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/overview/)
- [Testing with APIClient (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/#apiclient)

For next week, you should have all your viewsets done in their simplest form. You should be able to create cards, get cards in their three different lists, update and delete cards, and make friend/follower relationships.
