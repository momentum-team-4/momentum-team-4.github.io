Today we looked at full-text search in Django, making JSON responses from views, and sending email. Here are some resources for doing this on your own:

- [Full text search](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/postgres/search/)
- To see how to set up your searches to be even more efficient, check out [Full Text Search in Django with PostgreSQL](https://www.netlandish.com/blog/2020/06/22/full-text-search-django-postgresql/).
- [`JSONResponse` objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/request-response/#jsonresponse-objects)
- [Send emails with Django and Gmail](https://dev.to/abderrahmanemustapha/how-to-send-email-with-django-and-gmail-in-production-the-right-way-24ab) - this article is poorly written, but it's the only one that shows app passwords.
