We covered a lot of ground this morning on building out more complex forms. Some resources we used:

- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
- [awesome-react directory](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)
- [Presentational and Container Components by Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

For Monday, you should have card creation done and listing of all cards and your cards. Optimally, you'd be able to make friends and see the cards from your friends. You probably won't have all features for your cards and that is ok.
