## Due Date
Note that this assignment is *not due tomorrow*. It will be due no earlier than Thursday. However, I've created the link so that you can start looking at it and working on it if you feel comfortable. For tonight, you should try four of the *Easy* assignments from Exercism. I would suggest looking at the following:

- Hello World
- Two Fer
- Hamming
- Raindrops
- Isogram
- High Scores
- Word Count
