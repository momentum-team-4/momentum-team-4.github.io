Great work these last four weeks, y'all. You should take a well-earned break this weekend, but I wanted to post two simple things for y'all to do to be prepared to start Python on Monday. I'd like you to try the first two, but don't stress if you can't get it to work, and don't spend too much time on it -- we'll sort it out on Monday before class begins.

### Things to do for Monday

#### Install exercism
Open a terminal and enter the following command verbatim (the && chains commands together, but only if the first one doesn't fail):
     brew update && brew install exercism

Exercism is a great tool we'll be using for doing warmup and learning exercises.

#### Install pipenv
Open a terminal and enter the following command verbatim:
     brew install pipenv

pipenv is a package management tool that will simplify the task of organizing complex Python projects.

#### Get to know Python
I'm including a few links to good beginner resources for anyone who's eager to get started.

### Quick note on Python 2 vs Python 3
There are two major versions of Python in common use -- Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 is no longer updated and support is being withdrawn, but because MacOS uses Python 2 in a few places, Python 2 is the default version. This is annoying and complicates things somewhat, but isn't too difficult to navigate around -- if you're trying out code you found on the internet, and it says (for example):
      python a_python_script.py

you should instead run:
    python3 a_python_script.py

There are a couple of other places where you may need to run slightly different commands, but I'll only go over one of them right now; if you try some of the exercism.io exercises this weekend,
it may tell you to run:
   pytest hello_world_test.py

Instead, you should run:
	 python3 -m pytest hello_world_test.py

(of course, hello_world_test.py could be any Python file).
