Today, we focused on how to handle authentication against an API from React. Specifically, we looked at:

- how to make controlled form elements
- how to handle form submission
- how to use Axios to make Ajax requests
- how to store a user token in localStorage
- how to use props to send that token to components that need it

There were several links we saw in class:

- [Our sample app](https://github.com/momentum-team-4/example--family-app-react)
- [Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)
- [useLocalStorage hook](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/)
- [Prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling/)

We didn't see this article in class, but I recommend it (I wrote it):

- [How to build a front-end app before you have an API](https://dev.to/momentum/how-to-build-a-front-end-app-before-you-have-an-api-3ai3)

For Thursday, you should have login and registration working. It would also be optimal if you had creating a simple (text-only) card working as well.
