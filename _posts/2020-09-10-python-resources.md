## General Links
### [Official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
- [Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
- [Built-in Types Reference Page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)
- [Built-in Functions Reference Page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
- [Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html)

### Other Important Python Links
- [PyPi - Python Package Index](https://pypi.org)
  - This is the official site where third party packages are hosted. If you're curious
	whether a package exists for the task you're trying to accomplish, this is where you
	should look!
- [Real Python](https://realpython.com)
  - A great source for tutorials and guides.
  
- [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)
  - This free e-book is a great, comprehensive, beginner-friendly guide to Python, that starts
	with the basics and covers all of the topics necessary to use Python fluently. It also has
	some great insights about software development. Definitely check this book out!

- [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures in Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html#google_vignette)
  - This is the best book I've found of its kind, and, while the material it covers is outside the scope of what we're doing in phase 2, I'd highly
	reccomend spending some time with it once you have the chance. It's a great introduction to computer science and problem solving that has something
	to offer to everyone, even if you don't have much math in your background. It also has some great insights about how to use Python's builtin data types
	effectively.

### Code Breaks
These short code exercises should give you practice working with basic elements of Python. I highly reccomend trying some!
